	<h2 id="about">About the trip</h2>
	<p>On 26th December 2018 Brian and myself are travelling to Amsterdam where we will stay for 6 days when we will fly to Milan and spend the rest of our trip in Italy before flying back on 5th January 2019. This is Brian's first holiday in over 10 years! He's particularly looking forward to Amsterdam, we've booked an airbnb in the centre and hope to be in the middle of everything. </p>

		<h2 id="dayone">Day One</h2>
		<p class="dayone"> <img src="resources/dayone/canal.jpg" class="canal"> We arrived in Amsterdam! We made the flight with plenty of time to spare because I wanted to do some shopping in duty free (I bought some MAC make up and some OPI nail polish - you never really know if you've made a saving). I normally travel alone and I can really appreciate the benefit of having someone with you to sit down and watch the bags leaving you to wander around with nothing but a purse ! Our flight boards a little late and immediately we get sight of some really rowdy passengers, Brian suggests it's to be expected on a flight to Amsterdam, there's a lot of drunk, noisy people, luckily the flight is only 55 minutes but I am super grateful for my eye mask and ear plugs. Although I knew they were noisy I feel like I must have missed something because next thing I know we're being told to stay in our seats because the police will be escorting the rowdy passengers off the plane!! This is met by a big cheer (this includes Brian) and a lot of "thank god for that." The Netherlands police are tall and efficient looking and we then have the quickest breeze through the airport, picking up baggage, hopping on a train to the center, and arriving, all in the space of about 20 minutes. In Amsterdam Central we quickly navigate to our Tram and there's a short walk to the flat. On the way Brian tells me to look out for places called "Coffeeshops" - these sell Weed, I (somewhat reluctantly) point one out on the walk and he says let's go in, I tell him that I'm nervous, not so reassuringly he says he's nervous too! Before we can think twice the door is being opened and we're ushered in, I look at the menu and start reading things out to him, in the end we go for a Muffin each. As we're leaving he says he'll go back later for something more serious (all talk). Hanneke's flat is lovely and there are post it notes dotted all over the place for me, wifi password, how to work the blinds, please water the plants, you can eat these chocolates! It's nice being in a home rather than a hotel. Review of the muffin to come shortly. (More photos <a href="photos.html"> here.</a>)
